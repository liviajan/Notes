  <h2>UML Diagrams - which to use and when</h2>
  <p><a href="https://drawio-app.com/uml-diagrams/">By Kymberly Fergusson</a>
  </p>
  <p>The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a diagramming notation (language) that lets you visualize systems and
    software. It’s one of the most popular forms of diagramming in software development and became an ISO standard in
    1997. Since then, there have been a few updates to add extra UML diagram types and to support new technologies in
    programming.</p>
  <p>There are two main categories and 14 different types of UML diagrams, each of which is used in a different
    situation.
  <ul>
    <li> <span> Structure diagrams:</span> show the static relationships between the components in the system.</li>
    <li> <span>Behavior diagrams:</span> show how the components in the system react to each other, they capture how the
      system changes, and in some diagrams, how it changes over time.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <button class="accordion">Use case diagrams</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Use case diagrams are created when you are looking at the requirements of your system or program. </p>

    <p> They represent the functions or features, the actors and how these relate to each other (their relationships).
    </p>

  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Class diagrams</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Object oriented programming languages are based on classes and the relationships between them. UML class diagram
      notation was developed to represent these programs visually.</p>

    <p> Classes contain their attributes (their data) and behaviors (member functions), and are related to each other
      with a variety of connectors.</p>

  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Sequence diagrams</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Sequence diagrams are used to visualize both interactions within programs, business processes and IT
      infrastructures. They describe the sequence of interactions (messages) between actors and objects (things like
      databases or external interfaces).</p>

  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Activity diagrams</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Activity diagrams model the behavior of users and systems as they follow a process. They are a type of flow chart
      or workflow, but they use slightly different shapes.</p>

  </div>

  <button class="accordion">State diagrams</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>State diagrams have been used in programming to describe the various states that a system can be in for decades.
      They aren’t limited to programming – every system and process has states. These diagrams are faster to create than
      activity or sequence diagrams, but show less information.

      State diagrams show which states lead to each other, and what triggers a change of state.</p>
    <p>The biggest difference between state diagrams and activity or interaction overview diagrams is that state
      diagrams do not (necessarily) show the sequence. They just show what states are possible and their entry and exit
      points, not when those states are entered.

      State diagrams can be very complex – you can nest state diagrams, put guards (true/false) before a state, add
      actions triggered by a state change, and even defer events to be processed at a later time. These diagrams can get
      very text-heavy, and the conditions are usually written for one specific programming language. This may make the
      diagrams complex to look at, but it can also make programming (and testing) faster as there is less room for
      misunderstanding.</p>

  <button class="accordion">Interaction overview diagrams</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>These UML diagrams are a combination of an activity diagram and sequence diagrams, where each individual activity
      is placed in its own frame, making it easier to see the different paths that need to be programmed when there are
      complex if-then-else decisions. Decisions are outside of the frames to show the flow of control between the
      various interactions.</p>
    <p>The interactions themselves, inside the frames, are very similar to sequence diagrams. Between the interactions
      you will have decisions (diamonds) and fork and join nodes (solid horizontal rectangles), and connectors to show
      the flow of control. There are also initial and final nodes to show the start and end of the overarching
      interaction.</p>

  <button class="accordion">Communication diagrams </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>These used to be called collaboration diagrams. They are similar to use case diagrams, detailing the information
      that is transferred. However, sequence diagrams are more often used to visualize the communication between objects
      as they are clearer and have a richer notation.</p>
    <p>Communication diagrams are another way to visualize the information more commonly represented by UML sequence
      diagrams. They are simpler than sequence diagrams and only show the messages that pass between the objects or
      roles in a software program, infrastructure, or any kind of process.</p>
    <p>If you have multiple scenarios in one use case, UML communication diagrams help you clearly identify what
      messages (data) need to be sent between objects/roles in each specific scenario.</p>
